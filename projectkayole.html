            <h2>Research / Discovery</h2>
            <p>To understand the problem and users, I conducted in-depth user interviews with painters, DIY enthusiasts, and contractors, alongside competitor analysis of leading paint ecommerce sites. Surveys revealed key pain points, such as difficulty in color matching, unclear product specifications, and friction in the checkout process for bulk orders. User personas were developed for segments like professional contractors seeking durable paints and homeowners needing eco-friendly options. This phase emphasized accessibility, with a focus on mobile users and those with varying levels of technical expertise, ensuring the site addressed real needs like quick product comparisons and reliable delivery information.</p>

            <h2>Planning: Wireframes, architecture, or data design.</h2>
            <p>The planning phase involved creating detailed wireframes using Figma to outline user flows, from product browsing to purchase completion. Site architecture prioritized a scalable e-commerce structure with categories for paints (e.g., interior/exterior, primers, brushes) and filters for attributes like color, finish, and brand. Data design included a robust product database with relational tables for inventory, user reviews, and order history, integrated with payment gateways. SEO-friendly URLs and a responsive grid layout were planned to enhance discoverability and usability across devices.</p>

            <h2>Execution: Tools, frameworks, languages used.</h2>
            <p>The project was executed using a custom stack: HTML5 and CSS3 for frontend structure and styling, JavaScript for dynamic elements like color swatches and cart updates. For the backend, PHP handled server-side logic with a MySQL database for product management. Frameworks included WooCommerce on WordPress for e-commerce functionality, Bootstrap for responsive design, and jQuery for interactive features. Additional tools were Adobe Illustrator for custom product icons and Git for version control. The site was deployed on a cloud hosting platform with SSL encryption for secure transactions.</p>

            <h2>Testing & Iteration: What changed and why?</h2>
            <p>Testing involved usability sessions with real users, cross-browser compatibility checks, and performance audits using tools like Google Lighthouse. Initial feedback highlighted slow load times on product pages and confusing navigation for color selection. Iterations included optimizing images, implementing lazy loading, and refining the UI with A/B testing on filter options, which improved conversion rates by 20%. Post-launch analytics via Google Analytics identified drop-off points in checkout, leading to simplified forms and added trust signals like customer testimonials. These changes enhanced user satisfaction and reduced cart abandonment.</p>
