            <h2>Research / Discovery</h2>
            <p>To understand the problem and users, I conducted extensive research through stakeholder interviews with the company's management and potential clients in the networking industry. I analyzed competitors' websites to identify gaps, such as outdated designs or lack of clear service differentiation. User surveys revealed that small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) needed intuitive, jargon-free explanations of services like fibre internet and CCTV. Pain points included confusing pricing and poor mobile responsiveness. This discovery phase informed a user-centric approach, focusing on clarity, trust-building visuals, and accessibility for non-technical users.</p>

            <h2>Planning</h2>
            <p>The planning phase involved creating wireframes using tools like Figma to map out user flows, from the homepage to service pages and contact forms. I designed a modular architecture with a content management system (CMS) backend for easy updates. Data design included structuring service information into categories (e.g., Networking Services, Fibre Internet, CCTV, Networking Solutions) with relational databases for testimonials and case studies. The site architecture prioritized SEO-friendly URLs, fast loading times, and scalability for future service expansions.</p>

            <h2>Execution</h2>
            <p>The project was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the frontend, ensuring responsive design across devices. For the backend, I utilized PHP with a MySQL database to handle dynamic content and form submissions. Frameworks included Bootstrap for layout and responsiveness, and jQuery for interactive elements like sliders and modals. Additional tools were Adobe Photoshop for custom graphics and icons, and Git for version control. The site was deployed on a shared hosting platform with SSL for security.</p>

            <h2>Testing & Iteration</h2>
            <p>Initial testing involved cross-browser checks (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and mobile usability tests using tools like BrowserStack. User feedback from beta testers highlighted issues with form validation and slow load times on fibre connections. Iterations included optimizing images, adding client-side validation with JavaScript, and integrating a CDN for faster delivery. A/B testing on call-to-action buttons increased conversion rates by 15%, leading to refinements in color schemes and messaging. Post-launch analytics via Google Analytics showed improved engagement, prompting further tweaks to the contact form for better lead capture.</p>
